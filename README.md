Discussions about PHP Language

Hi,

This repository contains some excerpts of the project I've been working on.
Each directory has one Class of interest and the respective index.php file depicts its use.
=================
The first one shows ho to use the Class CtrlCaptcha
=================
The second illustrates the use of Class IntDB 
It implements PDO and provides a very easy way to customize DB functions when you may need to change the database provider for example.
=================
The last consists in a session management Class CtrlSession wich prevents most common hijacking attacks.
=================
Please feel free to comment and share your view about the implementation.
